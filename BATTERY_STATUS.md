# Battery Status Implementation

This project now includes a real-time battery status feature using the Battery Status API.

## Features

### useBatteryStatus Hook

The `useBatteryStatus` hook provides real-time battery information including:

- **Battery level** (0-100%)
- **Charging status** (charging/discharging)
- **Charging time** (time until fully charged)
- **Discharging time** (time until battery depleted)
- **API support detection**

### Implementation Details

#### Hook Location
- File: `app/hooks/useBatteryStatus.ts`

#### Usage Example
```typescript
import useBatteryStatus from '../hooks/useBatteryStatus';

const MyComponent = () => {
  const batteryStatus = useBatteryStatus();
  
  return (
    <div>
      Battery: {batteryStatus.level}%
      {batteryStatus.charging ? ' (Charging)' : ''}
    </div>
  );
};
```

#### MenuBar Integration
The MenuBar component (`app/components/MenuBar.tsx`) has been updated to use the real battery status instead of dummy data.

### Browser Compatibility

The Battery Status API is supported in:
- ✅ Chrome/Chromium-based browsers
- ✅ Firefox (with some limitations)
- ❌ Safari (not supported)
- ❌ iOS browsers (not supported)

### Fallback Behavior

When the Battery Status API is not supported or access is denied:
- The hook returns `supported: false`
- Battery level defaults to 100%
- Charging status defaults to false
- The UI gracefully handles the unsupported state

### Security Considerations

- The Battery Status API may be restricted in some browsers due to privacy concerns
- HTTPS is required for the API to work in most modern browsers
- Some browsers may require user permission or interaction

### Testing

To test the battery status feature:

1. Use a device with battery support (laptop, mobile device)
2. Open the application in a supported browser
3. Check the MenuBar for real-time battery information
4. Try plugging/unplugging the charger to see charging status changes

### Demo Component

A demo component (`BatteryStatusDemo.tsx`) is available to showcase all battery status features in a dedicated UI.

## Changes Made

1. **Created** `useBatteryStatus` hook for real-time battery data
2. **Updated** MenuBar component to use real battery status
3. **Removed** dummy battery level state and interval
4. **Enhanced** battery icon display with charging indicator
5. **Added** charging status in tooltips and mobile drawer

The implementation provides a more accurate and useful battery status display while maintaining backward compatibility for unsupported environments.
